Bit Manipulation is a technique used in a variety of problems to get the solution in an optimized way. This technique is very effective from a Competitive Programming point of view. It is all about Bitwise Operators which directly works upon binary numbers or bits of numbers that help the implementation fast. Below are the Bitwise Operators that are used:

Bitwise AND (&)
Bitwise OR (|)
Bitwise XOR (^)
Bitwise NOT (!)
All data in computer programs are internally stored as bits, i.e., as numbers 0 and 1.

In computing, one of these true/false values is a bit. Primitives in C (int, float, etc) are made up of some number of bits, where that number is a multiple of 8. For example, an int may be at least 16 bits in size, where a char may be 8 bits. 8 bits is typically referred to as a byte. C guarantees that certain primitives are at least some number of bytes in size. The introduction of stdint.h in C11 allows the programmer to specify integer types that are exactly some number of bytes, which is extremely useful when using masks.
